# Escape-room

This is my first project for the arcade event from hackclub. Users should be able to pick up items, inspect, and solve puzzles by interacting with the room. This is intended to be a game where I can try out some ideas in my head and hopefully learn or at least reenforce my ideas in the process. I've always been a fan of escape rooms so I've decided this would be a wonderful project to work over the summer.
