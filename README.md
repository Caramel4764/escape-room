# Escape-room

This is my first project for the arcade event from hackclub. Users should be able to pick up items, inspect, and solve puzzles by interacting with the room. This is intended to be a game where I can try out some ideas in my head and hopefully learn or at least reenforce my ideas in the process. I've always been a fan of escape rooms so I've decided this would be a wonderful project to work over the summer.

#AI usage
Codeium is occasionally enabled to help me write code. It offers suggestions to autocompletes my current line of code-very often for a file's path directory. Probably around 5-10% of my code is generated by codeium.
